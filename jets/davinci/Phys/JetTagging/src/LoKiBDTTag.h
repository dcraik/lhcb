   * Jet tagging via the secondary vertex (SVR) method of LHCb-ANA-2014-074.
   *
   * The jet tagging algorithm of LHCb-ANA-2014-074 builds two-body
   * SVRs. When a jet is supplied, the two-body SVRs within the cone
   * of the jet, set by m_dr, are linked if they share a common track
   * to produce n-body vertices. Two BDTs are calculated for each
   * n-body SVR. BDT0 separates light jets (low response) from heavy
   * jets (high response). BDT1 separates c-jets (low response) from
   * b-jets (high response).

     * "TagX_Y" where X is the index of the SVR, beginning from zero,
